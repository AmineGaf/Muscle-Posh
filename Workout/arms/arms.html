            <p>Working out your arms has many benefits. It can increase your muscle strength, muscle tone, and lean muscle mass. It can also reduce your risk of injury, improve your posture, protect your bones, and stabilize your joints.

                For a complete, balanced fitness program, try to alternate your arm-strengthening routine with exercises that target your lower body and core. Also include aerobic exercise in your weekly routine to boost your cardiovascular health</p>

        <div class="Close-Grip">
            <h1>Close-Grip Bench Press</h1> 
            <div><img class="Close-Grip1" src="img/Close-Grip Bench Press.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p> <span>To warm up, grab some lighter weight and knock out a warm-up set of 12-15 reps. Your hands should be lined up with the start of the knurling. Try not to lock out the joints at the top of the movement.

                Whenever you're locked out, it puts the stress on the joints, not on the muscles. By keeping your joints bent, you'll keep constant stress on your triceps, which makes the exercise much harder.</p>

            <h1>EZ-Bar Curls</h1>
            <div><img class="EZ-Bar1" src="img/EZ-Bar Curls.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>Keep your elbows back and really squeeze at the top. You want to feel the contraction when your biceps are at the peak of the exercise.
                 It will make a world of difference in your pump and the soreness you'll feel in the days after the workout.</p>

            <h1>Standing Hammer Curls</h1>
            <div><img class="Hammer-Curls1" src="img/Standing Hammer Curls.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p> Do these properly: keep your elbows back and curl with your hands slightly out. 
                We want your brachialis to contract as much as possible. Although we use dumbbells, try to curl with both hands at the same time. 
                When you get too fatigued to curl with both hands at once, switch to alternating.</p>

            <h1>Triceps Push-Down</h1>
            <div><img class="Push-Down1" src="img/Triceps Push-Down.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p> We want you to really exhaust the muscles during this exercise so you can get as much blood into them as you can before we move onto biceps.
                 Turn your hands out at the end so you can get a really good contraction.</p>

            <h1>EZ-Bar Skullcrusher</h1>
            <div><img class="Bar-Skullcrusher1" src="img/EZ-Bar Skullcrusher.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p> We use the EZ-bar to take a little stress off of your wrists. 
                It's really important that you keep your elbows tucked and the movement slow and controlled.
                 If your elbows are out, you'll use your shoulders instead of your triceps and set yourself up for an injury. </p>
