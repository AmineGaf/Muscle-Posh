            <p>Lifting a weight that’s too heavy for you is a mistake regardless of the part of the body you’re working, but it can be truly disastrous when performing shoulder exercises. The shoulders are delicate and complicated joints that are not especially easy to target, and if you do put them under too much pressure before they’re ready you can end up with injuries that put you out of action for months.</p>

        <div class="Push-Press">
            <h1>Push-Press</h1> 
            <div><img  src="img/Push-Press.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p> <span>This press allows you to load up more weight, and do more reps, than just about any other overhead exercise,
                 making it a great way to unlock new shoulder growth.It's rightfully considered a bit more of a whole-body movement than a pure shoulder move, 
                 since your lower body, core, delts, triceps, and upper pecs are all involved.</p>

        <div class="Dumbbell-Press">
            <h1>Seated Dumbbell Press</h1>
            <div><img class="Dumbbell-Press1" src="img/Seated Dumbbell Press.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p>Swapping out the barbell for dumbbells on overhead presses works each side independently, which is great for balanced development.
                 The range of motion is also a bit longer, which can help maximize muscle growth. 
                Pressing in a seated position also removes the lower body, allowing you to focus squarely on the shoulders.</p>

        <div class="Upright-Row">
            <h1>Upright Row</h1>
            <div><img class="fourth" src="img/Upright-Row.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p> Upright rows have a reputation as a shoulder destroyer, but like anything, it's all about how you perform them. 
                As personal trainer Jimmy Peña explains in the article, "How Wide Should My Grip Be on an Upright Row," don't take a close grip, which can internally rotate your shoulders.
                 Instead, take a wider grip where your upper arms go directly out to your sides. </p>
            <ul class="images">

                <li><img class="Upright-Row1" src="img/Upright-Row1.jpg" alt=""></li>

        <div class="Lateral-Raise">
            <h1>Lateral Raise</h1>
            <div><img class="fifth" src="img/Lateral Raise.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p> This is one of the most popular and best isolation exercises in the weight room, but it's tougher to master than it seems. 
                Beginners usually benefit from two cues: lead with your elbows, and only go down until your arms are about 30 degrees out from your sides.
                 Both will help your raises be better—and more difficult.</p>

        <div class="Face-Pull">
            <h1>Face Pull</h1>
            <div><img class="Face-Pull1" src="img/Face Pull.jpg" alt=""></div>
            <p> Face pull exercises can increase your shoulder health. The face pull targets muscle groups around your shoulder joints—specifically the posterior deltoids (rear delts) and rotator cuff muscles like the infraspinatus—improving scapular stability and strength. </p>
