                    <p>Bodybuilding is centered around building your body’s muscles through weightlifting and nutrition. <br>

                    Whether recreational or competitive, bodybuilding is often referred to as a lifestyle, as it involves both the time you spend in and outside the gym. <br>
                    
                    In order to maximize your results from the gym, you must focus on your diet, as eating the wrong foods can be detrimental to your bodybuilding goals.</p>

                    <p>Like training, diet is a vital part of bodybuilding. <br>

                        Conversely, consuming the wrong foods or not consuming enough of the right ones will leave you with subpar results.<br>
